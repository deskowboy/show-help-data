## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [API Key](#getting-your-api-key): You’ll need to sign up and get an API key from our platform.
- HTTP Client (e.g., Postman, cURL) or SDK support for [Golang](https://golang.org), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Python](https://www.python.org), etc.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/payment-gateway-api.git
   cd payment-gateway-api

   go mod download  # For Go
   npm install      # For Node.js
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python
```

Getting Your API Key
To start using the API, you'll need to obtain an API key from the developer portal.

Basic Usage Example
Here’s an example of making a simple payment request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.paymentgateway.com/v1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 10000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "payment_method": "credit_card",
    "card": {
      "number": "4111111111111111",
      "expiry_month": "12",
      "expiry_year": "2025",
      "cvc": "123"
    }
  }'
```

Advanced Features
1. Custom Payment Pages
The API allows you to create fully customizable payment pages for your customers. You can modify the look and feel of the page to match your brand.

2. Fraud Detection & Prevention
We use machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. You can access additional data points to make informed decisions.

3. Multi-Currency & Auto-Conversion
With our multi-currency support, you can easily accept payments from customers around the world, and the API automatically converts the currency at the current exchange rate.

4. Handling Webhooks
Set up a webhook listener to handle events like payment_completed, payment_failed, and refund_processed. Example setup:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-webhook-endpoint.com \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event": "payment_completed",
    "transaction_id": "tx_123456789"
  }'

   ```

5. Tokenization
For increased security, you can tokenize customer payment information to reuse it in future transactions without storing sensitive data.

Error Handling
The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure. For example:

200 OK – Success
400 Bad Request – Invalid request parameters
401 Unauthorized – Invalid API key
500 Internal Server Error – Something went wrong on our end
